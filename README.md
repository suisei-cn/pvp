# pvp-youtube
Precise video playback on YouTube. We also generate the shell script, and you can easily get the audio clip running this on a machine with `youtube-dl` and `ffmpeg`. Useful for video meme creators.

To use this, you need to install [ViolentMonkey](https://github.com/suisei-cn/pvp-youtube/raw/master/pvp.user.js) or [GreaseMonkey](https://www.greasespot.net/) first, then click [here](https://github.com/suisei-cn/pvp-youtube/raw/master/pvp.user.js) to install the user script.

**Note that this project is not meant to do any harm to anyone who has been in a YouTube video. You shall take the responsibility if your audio or video clip annoys anyone.**
