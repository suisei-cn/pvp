Precise video playback on YouTube/Bilibili. We also generate the clip shell script (audio only by default), and you can easily get the clip running this on a machine with `youtube-dl` as well as `ffmpeg`.

## Feature

- Better control your video playback
- Quick jump
- Quick repeat
- Add cut points
- Import/export cut points
- Generates `ffmpeg` scripts for the audio clip
- Free and open source!

It is for you if you need to:

- Cut multiple audio clips from a video
- Do the timing for a video
- Share a clip of a video to others

## Usage

To use this, you need to install a userscript manager such as [ViolentMonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/) or [GreaseMonkey](https://www.greasespot.net/).
